# Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches

Python projects on DataCamp

_Perform a hypothesis test to determine if more goals are scored in women's soccer matches than men's!_

## Project Description
Time to begin applying statistical testing skills to historical data of men's and women's international soccer matches!

I'll be working as a sports journalist at a major online sports media company, specializing in soccer analysis and reporting. I'll perform a hypothesis test to determine if more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches than in men's.

## Project Instruction
Perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine the p-value, and hence result, of whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's. Use a 10% significance level.

For this analysis, I'll use Official FIFA World Cup matches since 2002-01-01, and I'll also assume that each match is fully independent, i.e., team form is ignored.


## Project Coverage
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Filtering the data
3. Choosing the correct hypothesis test
4. Performing the hypothesis test
5. Interpreting the result of hypothesis test
